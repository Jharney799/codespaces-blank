                <h2>Who's this James guy?</h2>
                <p>I'm a student of technology, a philosopher, an ever aspiring stoic, a husband, friend, hacker, and creative. I'm a fully realized creation and the author of this website. Welcome and thanks for visiting my corner of the internet.</p>
                <h3>Alright, what's this place?</h3>
                <p>A <a>self-hosted</a> website written and maintained by me, James Harney. Originally I foresaw a spot where I could slowly collect code I have written and post my blog, of course that's lame and I couldn't be bothered.</p>
                <p>Instead of some soulless repository for various things, I am planning on making this place a personal source of knowledge with all my favorite stuff around the internet. I have drawn great inspirations from <a href="https://sive.rs/">Derek Sivers</a> and his excellent guide on self-hosting and writing your own website and recommend everyone reads <a href="https://sive.rs/ti">the following</a> before they spend another minute online.</p>
